<!-- Building for production 

Before we deploy our website we meed to prepare ir for production. We use a built tool.

Using a built tool we can:
                            - Combine CSS and JS files - can reduce the number of HTTP requests sent from the browser to the server.

                            - Minify Js / CSS files - We can remove all the extra spaces, comments and unnecessary characters. We can reduce the size of
                                                        our assets and deliver smaller files to the user.

                            - Optimize images 

What tools should we use?

    - Webpack - requires alot of configuration. Not good for begginers

    - Rollup 

    - Parcel - Good for begginers who dont want to do alot of configuration!

How to use Parcel?

    - First install node.js

    - open terminal (ctl+รง)

    - node -v - to check of node is installed properly

    - clear window ctl+l

    - NPM - node package manager - with this tool we can install third party libraries (also called third party dependencies)

    - first initialize an NPM pachage in this directory:  npm init -y

    - now we have a new file called package.json. In this file we have information about our project

    - install Parcel: npm i -D parcel-bundler

    - New folder node_modules - wen we install a new library using NMP it ends getting stored in this folder. One of the folders inside is Parcel (parcel-bundler)

    - We dont need all this files in our repository so we need to create a special file .gitignore

    - in this file we can list the files or folders that we want to ignore: write .... node_modules/)

    - Install Parcel globally so we can call it from any folder on this machine. Run on terminal :
                        prefix with "sudo" if on mac or linux +  nmp i -g parcel-bundler

    - on terminal run: parcel index.html

    - parcel comes with his own developments server whos running on a localhost

    - it will generate two new folders and need to be addet to .gitignore file: dist/ , .cache/

    - Building for production, run: parcel build index.html (generates error. Remove the xlink: prefix from html markup in index.html) )

    - creates a Dist folder. has the minified html and css files
